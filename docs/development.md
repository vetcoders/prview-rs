# Developer guide

This document covers working on the `prview` repo.
If you just want to use the tool, see `docs/usage.md`.
If you want to understand the module layout and execution flow, see `docs/architecture.md`.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vetcoders/prview-rs.git
cd prview-rs
cargo build
```

## Development workflow

### Branching model (trunk-based on `main`)

This repo is trunk-based:

- `main` is the trunk and the stable release branch
- feature / fix / chore branches (`feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`) are created from `main`
- every branch opens a PR back into `main`
- PRs land as merge commits (no squash)
- release tags (`v*`) are cut from `main`

### Build & run

```bash
# Debug build (faster compile)
cargo build
./target/debug/prview --help

# Release build (optimized)
cargo build --release
./target/release/prview --quick
```

### Rebuild on change

```bash
cargo install cargo-watch
cargo watch -x build
```

### Tests

```bash
cargo test --lib
cargo test --test json_contract
```

For resource-constrained validation, run stages sequentially with explicit caps:

```bash
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 RAYON_NUM_THREADS=2 RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test --locked -- --test-threads=1
```

Caps supplement test correctness. Subprocess tests must use small owned fixtures,
bounded waits, and cleanup on assertion failure or timeout. The MCP contract
harness bounds each RPC response and cleans its owned process tree before reaping
the server, so a timed-out deep-review test cannot discard the live ancestry
needed to find its detached review. A cleanup failure is a failed test, not a
successful timeout. Pagination over a finite fixture also has a finite page bound.

JSON and MCP binary contract tests use `tests/support/mod.rs` to own a temporary
`PRVIEW_HOME` and prepend a local Semgrep test double to each child process's
`PATH`. The fixture returns an empty successful scan without downloading rules
or starting the operator's scanner. Other tools retain their normal discovery.
The owner survives artifact inspection and repeated update runs; for MCP it
survives until the session is dropped. Tests can explicitly override `PATH` or
`PRVIEW_HOME` when that behavior is the subject of the contract. No parent-process
environment mutation or manual PATH preparation is required. This harness tests
CLI/MCP contracts, not real Semgrep detection; production discovery and scanner
dogfood remain separate. Library pipeline/watch fixtures explicitly set
`skip_security = true` to disable Semgrep. Setting `run_security = false` alone
does not disable Semgrep. The shared `test_config()` does not opt out of
Semgrep, so eligibility tests can still exercise default discovery. The test double has POSIX shell and Windows command
script implementations; runtime evidence must still name the platform exercised.
On Windows, Semgrep resolves the executable with the same `which` discovery used
for eligibility and passes its full path to the command runner. Rust's default
extensionless lookup only adds `.exe`; it would miss the owned `.cmd` fixture.
The Windows CI job runs both the fixture executable test and a real CLI review
whose provenance must identify that exact temporary scanner path.

Process-tree cancellation has platform-specific proof. Unix coverage runs in the
normal Linux/macOS suites. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` also runs the Windows-only
PowerShell child+grandchild census on `windows-latest`; cross-compilation alone
is not accepted as Windows cancellation evidence.

The same workflow has an `ubuntu-latest` ordinary-machine acceptance job. It
builds the release binary and runs bare `prview --deep` (with fixture/output
arguments, but deliberately without `--resource-budget`)
against `tools/fixtures/bounded-runtime`, a real mixed Rust, TypeScript,
JavaScript, and CSS repo. The fixture installs TSC, ESLint, Stylelint, and
Vitest; the workflow also installs a pinned real Semgrep scanner. The
stdlib-only `tools/bounded_runtime_acceptance.py` sampler requires all six tool
families (Cargo, Vitest, Semgrep, TSC, ESLint, and Stylelint) to appear in the
owned process census and to have an exact, live, non-cached `passed` row in
`RUN.json`; a skipped or failed process launch is not acceptance evidence. It
fails when more than one
whole-machine tool is active, when a Cargo/rustc, Vitest, or Semgrep pool
exceeds the selected cap, or when the final pack and its resource metadata do
not agree. This proves the CLI default itself resolves to the one-parent,
one-child `safe` envelope; an explicit selector cannot hide default-wiring
drift. Semgrep RPC coordinators are reported separately from its actual scan
workers. The receipt also requires a clean source tree whose `HEAD` is the exact
candidate SHA. The release build embeds that exact `PRVIEW_SOURCE_SHA`; the
harness probes it from the binary, requires it to match the requested commit,
and records the binary's SHA-256 digest. A dirty or stale local build therefore
cannot masquerade as exact-SHA evidence. The
job keeps its failure-shaped receipt under the runner's temporary directory so
initializing that evidence cannot dirty the checkout it is about to validate.
It has an internal 20-minute deadline inside a 45-minute Actions timeout, then
always uploads a compact JSON receipt plus the captured CLI log.
Only the published job on the exact candidate SHA is platform evidence; a local
run validates the harness, not the `ubuntu-latest` envelope.
The mixed fixture intentionally has no Python project, so this receipt does not
prove uv/PEP 517/pytest-xdist limits; those are covered by the Rust contract
tests and their real behavior remains part of repository-specific dogfood.

For Rust review flow, a standard `prview` run executes tests by default.
You disable them only with a lighter preset (`--quick`, `--update`, `--ai-only`)
or an explicit `--skip-tests`. Exception: standard `--remote-only` is now a
deliberately faster preset, so tests must be restored there with `--with-tests`
or by using `--deep`.

### Linting

```bash
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all
```

Likewise, lint is on by default for Rust in standard mode. `--with-lint` mostly
matters when you want to restore it after a lighter preset. Under standard
`--remote-only`, heavy Rust lint (`clippy`, `rustfmt`) is trimmed, so `--with-lint`
or `--deep` restores the fuller pass.

### Git hooks

`make git-hooks` installs the repo's hooks. They are fast push/commit guards
only: the pre-commit hook runs `rustfmt --check` on staged `.rs` files and
nothing else. No hook compiles the crate or runs a heavy gate (`cargo check`,
`cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, `cargo build`, `prview gate`) — that proof belongs
to required CI and to the local gate below, invoked explicitly. There is no
pre-push hook in this repo; downstream adopters can opt in to one via
[`docs/gate-playbook.md`](gate-playbook.md).

### Local gate

Before pushing, run the same gate CI runs:

```bash
make precommit   # fast pre-commit gate
make check       # full local gate (fmt + clippy + tests)
```

### Dashboard interaction gate

For a generated pack containing failed checks and located findings, the optional
DOM gate exercises the evidence reader without network requests:

```bash
npm install --prefix /tmp/prview-dom-qa --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund jsdom@29.1.1
NODE_PATH=/tmp/prview-dom-qa/node_modules node tools/test_dashboard_reader.cjs /path/to/pack/dashboard.html
```

Use Node 20.19+, 22.13+, or 24+. The fixture should contain the merge gate,
provenance, failure summary, review narratives, SARIF, and full patch. The test
adds in-memory stress fixtures for pagination and relative Markdown links.
It covers Markdown/raw switching, source preview, exact repeated search matches,
preserved inline links, original download content, English/Polish, script
errors, and that the labels for checks which never ran (`status.skipped`,
`status.error`, and the not-executed messages) never read as success in either
locale. File-origin navigation is checked without URL rewriting; HTTP navigation
retains section hashes. The DOM stubs do not establish visual layout, native downloads, or browser
`file://` behavior; check those separately in a real browser on desktop and a
narrow viewport.

### Documentation

```bash
cargo doc --open
```

```

## Adding a new check

1. **Create the file** `src/checks/newcheck.rs`:

```rust
use super::{run_command, Check, CheckResult, CheckStatus};
use crate::Config;
use anyhow::Result;
use async_trait::async_trait;

pub struct NewCheck;

#[async_trait]
impl Check for NewCheck {
    fn name(&self) -> &str {
        "NewCheck"
    }

    fn can_run(&self, config: &Config) -> bool {
        // When this check makes sense
        config.profile.has_something
    }

    async fn run(&self, config: &Config) -> Result<CheckResult> {
        let start = std::time::Instant::now();

        let output = run_command("mytool", &["--check"], &config.repo_root).await?;

        let status = if output.status.success() {
            CheckStatus::Passed
        } else {
            CheckStatus::Failed
        };

        Ok(CheckResult {
            name: self.name().to_string(),
            status,
            duration: start.elapsed(),
            output: String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout).to_string(),
            cached: false,
        })
    }
}
```

2. **Register it in** `src/checks/mod.rs`:

```rust
mod newcheck;
pub use newcheck::NewCheck;

fn get_checks_for_profile(config: &Config) -> Vec<Box<dyn Check>> {
    let mut checks = Vec::new();

    // Add in the right place
    if config.run_lint {
        checks.push(Box::new(NewCheck));
    }

    checks
}
```

## Adding a new profile

In `src/config/mod.rs`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum ProfileKind {
    Js,
    Rust,
    Python,
    Mixed,
    Generic,
    NewLanguage,  // Add
}

fn detect_profile(repo_root: &PathBuf, requested: Profile) -> Result<DetectedProfile> {
    // Add detection
    let has_newlang = repo_root.join("newlang.config").exists();

    // ...
}
```

## Adding a new artifact

Two places depending on the type:

### Core artifact (always generated)

In `src/artifacts/mod.rs`, add it to the right numbered-layout section:

```rust
pub fn generate(...) -> Result<PathBuf> {
    // ...
    // 20_quality/
    generate_my_artifact(&quality_dir, diffs)?;
    // ...
}

fn generate_my_artifact(dir: &Path, diffs: &[Diff]) -> Result<()> {
    let content = "...";
    std::fs::write(dir.join("my_artifact.txt"), content)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### Signal generator (only written when it has meaningful data)

Signal generators live in `src/artifacts/signal/`, one module per domain. Add
`src/artifacts/signal/my_signal.rs`:

```rust
pub fn generate_my_signal(dir: &Path, diffs: &[Diff]) -> Result<()> {
    let findings = analyze(diffs);
    if findings.is_empty() {
        return Ok(()); // No file = no noise
    }
    std::fs::write(dir.join("my_signal.txt"), format_findings(&findings))?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Then register it in `src/artifacts/signal/mod.rs` (`mod my_signal; pub use my_signal::*;`)
and call it from `artifacts/mod.rs` in the signal-generators section, with status logging.

### If you change the artifact-pack contract

When you change the layout, filenames, or review-flow semantics, update these
together with the code:

- `README.md` for the quick entry point
- `docs/usage.md` for the output layout and artifact interpretation
- `docs/architecture.md` for the module map and responsibilities
- `docs/contracts/merge_gate.md` if the `MERGE_GATE.json` schema or paths change

Pay special attention to root-level navigators (`AI_INDEX.md`, `PR_REVIEW.md`,
`report.json`) and the numbered layout in `00_summary/`, `10_diff/`,
`20_quality/`, `30_context/`.

The `--json` stdout is not a full export of the artifact pack. Treat it as a
compact contract for automation; the full truth about a run stays in the
artifacts written to disk.

## Testing

### Unit tests

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_profile_detection() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Integration tests

```bash
# Test against a real repo
cd /path/to/some/repo
/path/to/prview/target/debug/prview --quick
```

## Debugging

### Debug prints

```rust
// Temporary debug prints
eprintln!("DEBUG: {:?}", variable);
```

### RUST_BACKTRACE

```bash
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run -- --quick
```

### RUST_LOG (if you add tracing)

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- --quick
```

## Performance

### Profiling

```bash
cargo build --release
perf record ./target/release/prview --quick
perf report
```

### Benchmarking

```bash
hyperfine './target/release/prview --quick'
```

## Release

The release workflow, its required signing/notarization secrets and the
`workflow_dispatch` dry run are documented in [Releasing prview](RELEASING.md).
This section covers only local builds.

### Build the release binary

```bash
cargo build --release
ls -la target/release/prview
```

### Cross-compilation (optional)

```bash
# Linux (from Mac)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

# Windows (from Mac)
cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```

The Windows build above is only a compile check. Claimed Windows cancellation
support depends on the real `windows-latest` process-tree job. It exercises
`taskkill /T /F` for governor cancellation and Job Object ownership for async
checks and synchronous context wrappers whose root exits before a descendant;
all captured descendant PIDs must disappear.

Cancellation is deliberately immediate: Unix first freezes the owned process
group, inventories and freezes live PPID descendants that moved into their own
`setsid`/`setpgid` groups, and requires every visible member to remain stopped
or zombie across two censuses before sending `SIGKILL` leaf-first; Windows
force-terminates the Job Object tree. Unix cannot portably recover an
adversarial double-fork that was already reparented before cleanup. A killed
Cargo/rustc tree can leave a shared target directory dirty. The next Cargo
invocation should validate/rebuild it; remove that target directory only if
Cargo reports persistent corruption.

## Status note

This document describes the current way of working on the repo and extending the
code. It is not a product roadmap.

For the current state of CLI features:

```bash
prview --help
```

For the latest design decisions:

- check open PRs against `main`
- read `README.md` as the repo-level entry point
- treat historical plans under `docs/plans/` as a record of work, not a source of truth
```
